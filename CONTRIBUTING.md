# Contribution to this project

Contributing is not just about code! There is much more to a project. 

Contributions can include:

* **Starring** the project (at the top right)
* **Logging** a bug / idea or commenting on an existing ticket (issue)
* Fixing a **typo** in the text of the Application / website / documentation
* Documentation
* and of course committing code

### Issue

When creating / commenting on an **Issue**, try and look at it from someone else's perspective - remember then can not see your screen or read your mind. Capture as much useful information as possible while keeping it concise, use diagrams & screenshots to help.

### Branching

When creating a **Branch** use [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching & naming conventions

For example
```
feature/123-brief-description
```

### Commiting

When writing a **Commit** message, please prepend each commit message with the **Issue** number. 

For example:
```
[#123] This is my commit message
```

### Pull Requests

Todo.


### Feature development

* For each feature, we will iterate through the following tasks:
`Prototype > Wireframes > Implement Wireframes > Design > Implement Design > Done`


* Reviews will occur at each step of the process `(Task > Pull Request > Review > Commit)`


* **NOTE:** The Prototype branch is meant as a proof of concept and  must not (ever!) be merged into mainstream
