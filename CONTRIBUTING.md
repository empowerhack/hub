# Contribution to this project

Contributing is not just about code! There is much more to a project. 

Contributions can include:

* **Starring** the project (at the top right)
* **Logging** a bug / idea or commenting on an existing ticket (issue)
* Fixing a **typo** in the text of the Application / website / documentation
* Documentation
* and of course committing code

### Issue

When creating / commenting on an **Issue**, try and look at it from someone else's perspective - remember then can not see your screen or read your mind. Capture as much useful information as possible while keeping it concise, use diagrams & screenshots to help.

### Branching

For example
```
feature/123-brief-description
```

### Commiting

When writing a **Commit** message, please prepend each commit message with the **Issue** number. 

For example:
```
