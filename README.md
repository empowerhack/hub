### Project structure

Standard **Spring boot** structure.

### Feature development

* For each feature, we will iterate through the following tasks:
`Prototype > Wireframes > Implement Wireframes > Design > Implement Design > Done`


* Reviews will occur at each step of the process `(Task > Pull Request > Review > Commit)`


* **NOTE:** The Prototype branch is meant as a proof of concept and  must not (ever!) be merged into mainstream
